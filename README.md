Clone of Google's Homepage in HTML/CSS

For this project, I created (or at least attempted to create) a simple replica of Google’s homepage using HTML and CSS.
The goal was to recreate the page structure while following good web development practices.

The page is made up of three main sections:

A header containing links to Gmail, Images, Apps, and Sign in, positioned in the top right corner.

A central body where you’ll find the Google logo, a search bar, and two buttons: “Google Search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky.”

Some <div> elements showing the location and links similar to those found on Google’s website.

The styling is handled via an external CSS stylesheet,
which helps align elements, apply typography close to Google’s, and ensure a clean layout.

This project helped me understand the importance of HTML and CSS in building websites.
