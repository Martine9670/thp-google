### 🛠️ Project Goal

Recreate the visual structure of the **Google homepage** to practice web development fundamentals:  
- Positioning elements  
- Using semantic HTML tags  
- Styling with external CSS  
- Following best practices (clean layout, responsive, well-organized)

### 🧱 Page Structure

The page is divided into **three main sections**:

1. **🔝 Header**  
   Contains links to *Gmail*, *Images*, *Apps*, and *Sign In*,  
   all positioned in the top right corner, just like the original.

2. **🔍 Main Body**  
   Includes:
   - Google’s logo (image)
   - A search bar
   - Two buttons: `Google Search` and `I'm Feeling Lucky`

3. **🌍 Footer**  
   Displays location information and links similar to those found on the real Google homepage.
